# src/bird — bird embodiment, physics, camera

The `BirdSystem` facade IS the bird — mesh, flight physics, walk physics, camera
rig, mode transitions. App code only ever touches this one class (via
`BirdSystemApi` in `../types.ts`); the rest of this directory is internal.

```
bird/
  BirdSystem.ts     facade: pose, mode machine, craft swap, delegates to controllers
  mesh.ts           procedural low-poly tern; wing/foot rig; per-mode pose
  biplaneMesh.ts    procedural Wright-Flyer biplane; airspeed-driven prop
  craftMesh.ts      shared { root, update(pose, mode, dt) } interface both meshes satisfy
  craftTuning.ts    per-craft feel table + BIRD_TUNING / BIPLANE_TUNING presets
  flight.ts         stepFlight() — flying-mode physics + landing detection
  walk.ts           stepWalk()   — walking-mode physics + takeoff trigger
  camera.ts         CameraRig    — chase/first-person, spring damping, FOV ease
  collision.ts      floor clamp · 3-probe wall slide · bird→camera unclip
  tuning.ts         shared feel constants (rates, camera, palette) + landing ease
  index.ts          public re-export of BirdSystem
```

## Craft swap (C key, bird ⇄ biplane)

`BirdSystem` builds both meshes up-front and stores a `CraftTuning` reference
that `stepFlight` and `CameraRig.update` read each frame. `setCraft(kind)`:

1. Swaps the mesh child inside the stable `this.object` Group (App keeps a
   scene-graph handle to that Group; we never replace it).
2. Points `tuning` at the new preset (`craftTuning.ts::getCraftTuning`).
3. Clamps `pose.speed` UP to `tuning.MIN_AIRSPEED` (position/heading preserved).
4. Persists the choice to `localStorage['bfv.craft']`.

Bindings: `InputManager.onCraftToggle` fires on `C` (edge-triggered, text-entry
target check honored) and App wires it to `bird.setCraft(...)`. The C key rides
outside `InputState` because that contract is locked; keeping the DOM listener
inside `InputManager` still preserves the "single reader of DOM events" rule.

## Collision guarantees

- **Underground.** `enforceGroundFloor(pose, col, world)` clamps `pose.y` to
  at least `groundBelow(pose).point.y + epsilon` every frame in every mode
  (including the landing ease and takeoff pop). If `world.groundBelow` is null
  (tile unloaded), the last known safe ground is used as the floor.
- **Walls.** `wallSlide(pose, velX, velZ, lookahead, world)` casts three probes
  (nose + each wingtip at `WINGTIP_OFFSET` lateral) from `WALL_PROBE_LIFT`
  above the bird — a high-y raycast so the topmost surface at the probe's
  (x,z) is what's returned, not an interior floor. On any hit, the horizontal
  velocity is projected onto the plane perpendicular to the combined outward
  normal. Bird skims the wall; no stop, no bounce.
- **Camera.** `unclipCamera(camPos, birdPos, world)` samples the bird→camera
  ray at `CAM_CLIP_SAMPLES` points; if any sample sits below the topmost
  surface at its (x,z), the camera is pulled to `CAM_CLIP_MARGIN` metres in
  front of that entry. Runs after damp, so smoothing sees an already-safe
  target and never eases through geometry.

## Contracts

- `BirdSystem implements BirdSystemApi` (`../types.ts`) — do not change the
  public shape. Coordinate frame: +X east, +Y up, −Z north, meters.
- **Yaw** = 0 at north (−Z), positive = clockwise from above. Applied to the
  mesh via `rotation.set(pitch, -yaw, -roll, 'YXZ')` — see the top of `mesh.ts`
  for why. `headingVector(yaw)` in `flight.ts` is the canonical conversion.
- The bird owns `camera`. App never creates a camera of its own; it just
  renders through `bird.camera`.
- **Keyboard-only.** Owner directive: the bird never follows the mouse. Neither
  `flight.ts` nor `walk.ts` reads `mouseDX/DY`, and `input.ts` never requests
  pointer lock. The `mouseDX/DY/pointerLocked` fields stay on `InputState`
  because `types.ts` is locked, but they always read 0 / false.

## Control mapping (keyboard only)

| Input | Flight | Walk |
|---|---|---|
| A/D or ←/→ | bank (target roll → coordinated yaw) | turn `pose.yaw` in place |
| W/S or ↑/↓ | pitch — stick-style, ↓/S = nose up | walk forward/back along facing |
| Space (tap) | flap impulse | hop |
| Space (hold) | wing-beat rhythm | ≥ `WALK_TAKEOFF_HOLD` → takeoff |
| Shift | air brake (harder below 30 m) | — |
| E | land (assist swoop onto `landingCandidate`) | takeoff |
| V | chase ⇄ first-person cam | same |

## State machine (all internal)

```
placeAt() → flying
flying   → perched (interact + landingCandidate.kind === 'building')
flying   → walking (interact + landingCandidate.kind === 'terrain')
perched  → flying  (interact or flap)
walking  → flying  (flapHold ≥ 0.3 s, or interact)
```

Landing is a short ease (`LAND_EASE_SEC`) — during ease `easeT > 0` and physics
is paused; the pose is lerped onto the touchdown point and orientation is
levelled out.

## Where to tune what

- **Per-craft feel** — `craftTuning.ts`: `BIRD_TUNING` / `BIPLANE_TUNING`. Speed
  envelope, MAX_STEP_M, bank/yaw, landing window, flap/throttle impulses.
  Both craft use the SAME steering rates, autolevel, gravity, and camera rig
  (`tuning.ts`), so they feel like one game with two vehicles.
- **Shared feel** — `tuning.ts`. Camera rig, autolevel rates, palette, landing
  ease/arc, wall-probe geometry.
- **Silhouette / palette** — `mesh.ts` for the bird, `biplaneMesh.ts` for the
  biplane, `tuning.ts` COLOR_* for hues (shared across both meshes).
- **Camera softness** — `CHASE_HALFLIFE_*` in `tuning.ts` (half-life = time to
  halve residual error). `CHASE_LATERAL_LAG` is the "bird leans into the turn,
  camera lags" magic number.
- **Wall behaviour** — `FORWARD_PROBE` + `MAX_STEP_M` in `tuning.ts`. Substepping
  happens automatically when speed × dt > `MAX_STEP_M`.

## How to extend

- New landing-target class → add a `kind` to `GroundHit` in `types.ts` (owned
  by coordinator, not us), then handle it in `BirdSystem.beginLandingEase()`.
- New input axis → extend `InputState` first (`types.ts`, coordinator), then
  add the reader in `../input.ts`, then consume in `flight.ts`/`walk.ts`.
- New camera view (e.g. cinematic) → add a variant to `CameraView` in
  `camera.ts` and a `compute*Target()` method; expose a toggle path.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- No physics in `mesh.ts`. Mesh reads pose, animates; never writes.
- No DOM in `bird/`. `InputState` is the only channel from the outside world;
  `WorldSource` is the only channel to the world.
- Do not import from `../world`, `../app`, or `../ui`. This module is
  independent — the coordinator glues it in.
